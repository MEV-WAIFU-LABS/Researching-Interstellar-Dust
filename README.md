Studying the Interstellar Dust
==============================

The study of intermediate-age open clusters can be used to the learn about the stellar
evolution of intermediate-mass stars and the dynamical evolution of clusters together with their interstellar extinction. The interstellar extinction is a sum of absorption and scattering of the light within the interstellar medium, being inversely proportional to the light wavelength. Consequently, a general increase in absorption toward shorter wavelengths is observed, resulting to the effect of reddening.

In this repository I made available the source code for data reduction and analysis in IDL, and my report and results as well.
